# CI/CD Pipeline for a Containerized Application Deployed on Kubernetes with Infrastructure as Code

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates setting up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a sample web application. The application will be containerized using Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes (or OpenShift), and the infrastructure provisioned using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Monitoring and logging are included to ensure operational excellence.

---

## Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. Define the Application
- Create a simple Python Flask or Node.js web application with:
  - A basic API endpoint (e.g., `/health`).
  - A simple web interface.

---

### 2. Version Control with Git
- Host the application code on a Git repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
- Use Git for version control, adhering to best practices:
  - Use branches for feature development.
  - Commit regularly with meaningful messages.

---

### 3. Containerize the Application
- Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
- Test the container locally using Docker or Podman.

---

### 4. Write Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Use **Terraform** or **Ansible** to:
  - Provision a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster (e.g., AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS).
  - Set up networking, load balancers, and storage.

---

### 5. Deploy Application to Kubernetes
- Write Kubernetes manifests for:
  - **Deployment**: To run application pods.
  - **Service**: To expose the application.
  - **Ingress**: For external access (optional).

---

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline
- Use **Jenkins** for the CI pipeline:
  - **Build Stage**: Automate the building of the Docker image.
  - **Test Stage**: Run unit tests and health checks.
  - **Deploy Stage**: Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
- Use **Argo CD** for continuous delivery to the Kubernetes cluster.

---

### 7. Automation with Scripting
- Use Python or Shell scripting to automate tasks such as:
  - Cleaning up old builds.
  - Running health checks for the application.

---

### 8. Monitoring and Logging
- Integrate the following tools:
  - **Prometheus and Grafana**: For monitoring.
  - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: For centralized logging.

---

### 9. Networking and Security
- Configure the Kubernetes cluster with:
  - Proper network policies to restrict traffic.
  - TLS certificates to secure communication.

---

### 10. Documentation
- Create comprehensive documentation for:
  - Project setup.
  - CI/CD pipeline flow.
  - Troubleshooting common issues.
