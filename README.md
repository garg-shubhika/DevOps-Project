Project Title:
"CI/CD Pipeline for a Containerized Application Deployed on Kubernetes with Infrastructure as Code"

Project Overview:
This project involves setting up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a sample web application. The application will be containerized using Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes (or OpenShift), and the infrastructure will be provisioned using IaC tools. You'll also include monitoring and logging to ensure operational excellence.

Steps to Complete the Project:
1. Define the Application
Create a simple Python Flask or Node.js web application with:
A basic API endpoint (e.g., /health).
A simple web interface.
2. Version Control with Git
Host the application code on a Git repository (GitHub or GitLab).
Use Git for version control, following Git best practices (e.g., branches, commits).
3. Containerize the Application
Write a Dockerfile to containerize your application.
Test the container locally using Docker or Podman.
4. Write Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Use Terraform or Ansible to:
Provision a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster (e.g., AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS).
Set up networking, load balancers, and storage.
5. Deploy Application to Kubernetes
Write Kubernetes manifests for:
Deployment: For running application pods.
Service: For exposing the application.
Ingress: For external access (optional).
6. CI/CD Pipeline
Use Jenkins to:
Build Stage: Automate the building of the Docker image.
Test Stage: Run unit tests and health checks.
Deploy Stage: Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
Use Argo CD for continuous delivery to the Kubernetes cluster.
7. Automation with Scripting
Use Python or Shell Scripting to automate repetitive tasks like:
Cleaning up old builds.
Health-check scripts for the application.
8. Monitoring and Logging
Integrate tools like:
Prometheus and Grafana: For monitoring.
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For logging.
9. Networking and Security
Configure the Kubernetes cluster with:
Proper network policies to restrict traffic.
TLS certificates for securing communication.
10. Documentation
Create detailed documentation for:
Setting up the project.
CI/CD pipeline flow.
Troubleshooting common issues.
Project Architecture:
Git: Stores code.
Jenkins: Automates building and testing.
Docker: Packages the app.
Argo CD: Deploys the containerized app to Kubernetes.
Kubernetes (or OpenShift): Orchestrates and manages containers.
Terraform: Provisions cloud infrastructure.
Prometheus/Grafana & ELK Stack: Monitors and logs application performance.
Deliverables:
A working application deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.
Fully functional CI/CD pipeline.
Documented codebase in GitHub.
Terraform or Ansible scripts for provisioning.
Monitoring dashboards and logs showcasing the app’s status.
Skills Practiced:
Git: Version control and branching.
Docker/Podman: Building and running containers.
Kubernetes/OpenShift: Deploying and scaling apps.
IaC (Terraform/Ansible): Automating infrastructure.
Jenkins/Argo CD: Setting up CI/CD pipelines.
Linux: Server and system management.
Python/Shell Scripting: Automation tasks.
